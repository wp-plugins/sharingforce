== Description ==
Sharingforce is a powerful web application that promotes Digital Word Of Mouth and helps to convert web traffic into high quality leads. You have the ability to inspire your readers by rewarding them for specific actions. Users can be rewarded for their own actions (for example, a Successful Share), or for referred actions taken by their friends (Referred Click, Referred Purchase, or other defined actions). Rewards can be contests, coupons and savings, through the 'Share to Win' or 'Share to Save' reward systems. Each action is rewarded through trackable Sharetificates to members, which Sharingforce issues on behalf of you, allowing them to redeem their rewards.

It is well known that recommendations from friends and key influencers are the most powerful forms of marketing, generating the highest levels of awareness and intention to act with potential customers, and therefore the highest ROI on marketing and customer acquisition investments.

Today's social networks comprise hundreds of millions of people, interacting and sharing information actively within their networks. By reaching the individuals populating and driving those social networks, and providing tools, content and rewards for sharing information and offers with their networks, the real power of these networks can be unleashed: a geometric pattern of reach as individuals share successively across their social networks - the very definition of viral marketing.

Research studies indicate that sharers will only share information that they find relevant to their network, as they will always protect their status within their network. But they also are of the view that their social status will increase within their network if they are the source of useful information and rewards for friends.

This paradigm shift to digital interaction has spawned a new revolution called Digital Word of Mouth(tm).
